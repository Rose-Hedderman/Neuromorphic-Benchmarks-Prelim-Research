# Neuromorphic-Benchmarks-Prelim-Research

This GitHub is a collection of resources and code that I (Rose) went through while attempting to replicate Nengo-Loihi's Keyword Spotting task while assisting James Boyle (PhD UT Austin) in developing neuromorphic benchmarks. 

The main paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01739.pdf

The GitHub associated with this paper: https://github.com/abr/power_benchmarks/

The tutorial for the example: https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-examples/loihi/keyword-spotting.html 


If you are only concerned with the Keyword Spotting documentation, see the README in that folder.


If you are interested or just learning about Neuromorphic Computing especially with respect to Computational Neuroscience, read below. 


I started this as a Neuroscience undergrad at UT Austin and want to consolidate what I have learned.

As an introduction to Neuromorphic Computing as a whole, these videos were a great introduction:
Garrick Orchard: Spiking Neural Networks for Event-based Vision:

RPG Workshopsâ€™ YouTube Page:
Helpful for various applications and current research on Event-based AI:

Telluride Neuromorphic Cognition Engineering Workshop:
Found them early on and looked like a great place with some interesting projects.

If you have a stronger neuroscience background, these resources on computational neuroscience were especially helpful:
BRIAN2 is my favorite brain simulator. To my research, it has the most well-organized information that I could find. 
 
INCF is a place where brain research is consolidated:
https://training.incf.org/

Course on Computational Neuroscience:

Neuronal Dynamics: Textbook/Tutorial on Computational Neuroscience using BRIAN2:
Best tutorial on any simulator I could find.
