This Audio Processing folder is a walk-through to how we replicated the audio processing steps with a separate audio file with hopes of creating new inputs to Keyword Spotting.

The wav file is of someone saying "hello." The file was processed and the MFCC transform was done in MatLAB. The results of the MFCC are in the file dataMatthewHello.txt.

I ran into challenges just figuring out MatLAB and finding a decent wav file.
